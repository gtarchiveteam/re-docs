# Gorilla Tag Reverse Engineering Documentation

This documentation outlines much of server side code and what the communications between clients and servers expect, largely focused on older versions of Gorilla Tag predating 2023.

It is important to note that this page does *not* provide out-of-box ready-to-use scripts to slap on your servers. You'll have to look at the docs and form your own implementation of how this all fits together.

p.s. Another Axiom, we do not condone using this for clones blah blah blah whatever
